### Learn how to find key support and resistance zones, determine scenarios, and read the market

If you want to become a self-reliant trader using your own analysis to formulate a trading plan each day, then consider subscribing to my paid service in which I daily detail exactly how I came up with the zones and scenarios I post for free on Twitter and Stocktwits each day. I believe one must trade their own analysis that they themselves implicitly understand to have full confidence in their execution and to be consistent.

The $25/month I charge for this compensates me for the time it takes to produce this extra content. I use Patreon as it is a secure and trusted membership platform that handles all membership logistics for me. $25/month is half a single ES point or 5 MES points for a single contract, which I think is completely reasonable compared to the ~$100+/month other services charge for half the content I provide.

From this service I guarantee you will learn how to read the market and be able to create your own zones and scenarios, which will be applicable to all financial markets and not just the S&P500. The goal is to turn you into a self-reliant trader with no need for paid subscription services providing analysis.

Through this service, I also answer members' questions relating to the daily analysis, as well as provide other exclusive membership perks such as automatic zone studies and zone files.
