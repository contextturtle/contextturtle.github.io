#### Key Lessons From Today
* Not every move can be traded. Today's 100+ point move though looks appealing in hindsight, was quite untradeable.
* When price slices through larger timeframe s/r without even a slight bounce and there are no underlying conditions nor structure supporting the move, then it's time to close your platform and do something else for the day.
