#### Key Lessons From Today
* Not all rotations/moves are the same. Where they start from and how they move from there is key. That is part of the context.
* Do not scale out because of your emotions. Scale out because of meaningful price action that is saying the idea is no longer valid. Scaling out to feel good is a losing strategy and one that has been pushed by gurus since the dawn of time.
