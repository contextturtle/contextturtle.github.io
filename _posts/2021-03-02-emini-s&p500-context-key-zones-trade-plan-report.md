### Learn how to find key support and resistance zones, determine scenarios, and read the market

Through Patreon I offer a paid service for $25/month in which I daily detail how I came up with the zones and scenarios for that given day. The $25/month is to compensate me for the time it takes to produce this extra content. I use Patreon as it is a secure and trusted membership platform that handles all the logisitcs for me. $25/month is half a single ES point or 5 MES points for a single contract, which I think is completely reasonable. From this service I guarantee you will learn how to read the market and create your own zones and scenarios, which will be applicable to all financial markets and not just the S&P500.
