### Learn how to find key support and resistance zones, determine scenarios, and read the market

If you want to become a self-reliant trader using your own analysis to formulate a trading plan each day, then consider subscribing to my paid service in which I daily detail exactly how I came up with the zones and scenarios I post for free on Twitter and Stocktwits each day. I believe one must trade their own analysis that they themselves implicitly understand to have full confidence in their execution and to be consistent.

The $25/month I charge for this compensates me for the time it takes to produce this extra content. I use Patreon as it is a secure and trusted membership platform that handles all membership logistics for me. $25/month is half a single ES point or 5 MES points for a single contract, which I think is completely reasonable compared to the ~$100+/month other services charge for half the content I provide.

From this service I guarantee you will learn how to read the market and be able to create your own zones and scenarios, which will be applicable to all financial markets and not just the S&P500. The goal is to turn you into a self-reliant trader with no need for paid subscription services providing analysis.

Through this service, I also answer members' questions relating to the daily analysis, as well as provide other exclusive membership perks such as automatic zone studies and zone files, as well as the trades I will be looking to execute that day.

Trading requires discretion based on experience and screen time. 

Everything I trade is traded in context of the scenarios laid out in the pre-market analysis. I firmly believe profitable trading is rooted in planned trades that eliminate the need to do much thinking during the day. 95% of trades I take are in the zones. The trades that are not planned and that I somehow find throughout the day are typically my losing trades.

#### There are two categories of trades I take
* Location based
* Momentum based

##### Location based

These trades are in areas that are likely to produce a bounce/reversal. The location is ideal from an r:r standpoint.

##### Momentum based

These trades involve a flip or breakout/breakdown of a key area when the market is moving swiftly. These types of trades often present less than favorable r:r (depending on the target) as with momentum the likelihood of a decent pull-back nearer to where the idea is wrong is significantly reduced. This means wider stops. Often with the ES these trades need to start as scalps as you will need to refine your entry given the wider stop required.

#### There are primarily four trade setups I take
* Zone fade reversal 
* Zone fade bounce 
* Breakout / breakdown 
* Zone flip / pull-back continuation

##### Zone fade reversal

This is a location based trade involving fading zones for short-term reversal of a move according to the scenarios.

##### Zone fade bounce 

This is a location based trade involving fading zones for a 2R+ bounce according to the scenarios. A reversal is not expected here, but a decent bounce off the zone is expected.

##### Breakout / breakdown 

This is a momentum based trade. This can be intraday balance breakout/breakdown or larger timeframe in context of the scenarios. You can take enter a trade at the breakout/breakdown area or wait for a pull-back to the breakout/breakdown area or a fib retracement level such as 23.6% or 38.2% if within the max 1R risk parameter.

##### Zone flip / pull-back continuation

This is often a momentum based trade, but can also be classified as a location-based trade when there is a lack of momentum, but the flip/pull-back continuation idea is still valid. This would be a pull-back to a key zone in context of the scenarios. 

#### Tools used for analysis to determine which scenario is in play
* NYSE and S&P500 advance-decline 
* NYSE TICK 
* Inter-market analysis between ES, NQ, and Russell
* Order-flow and delta

##### NYSE and S&P500 advance-decline 

Unless there is some very, very obvious divergence across both the NYSE and S&P500 ADs, then the AD is useless. If at the open, the ADs are very strong and showing very high values and the ES is below the prior day's cash close, then that has the potential to eventually be priced into the ES and cause a movement up. In addition, if at a key support zone and the ADs are both clearly holding up for the day, then that is a divergence and a has the potential to eventually be priced into the ES and cause a movement up.  These divergences are ONLY useful in context of the scenarios. The ADs diverging into a random zone means nothing by itself. Sure a bounce can occur, but that's not how to be consistent.

##### NYSE TICK

The NYSE TICK is a great broad market momentum gauge, indicating how aggressive buyers and sellers in the broad market are. When the TICK is swinging from +600s to -600s, the market is primarily balanced. When the TICK is primarily sustained above 0 and testing the +600s area or sustained below 0 and testing the -600s area, then the market is typically directional. NYSE TICK divergences have proven to be meaningless. I find Sierra Chart's NYSE TICK to utilize the most realistic and accurate calculation whereas Tradestation's is too filtered and averaged out and DTN's is seemingly invalid. The TICK is also a great gauge of volatility: if the TICK is swinging back and forth hitting +600s and -600s, that's a volatile market.

The NYSE TICK is not a crystal ball. The ES and TICK often diverge. What really matters is what the ES is doing in context of the scenarios. The TICK is a great momentum gauge of the broad market, but if the ES does not respond to that, then it is meaningless. We trade the ES, not the TICK.

##### Inter-market analysis between ES, NQ, and Russell 

Simply put, for sustained moves, the three indexes should be in alignment. If the ES is breaking out or breaking down and the move is to be sustained in the short-term, all three indices should be doing the same. If the NQ and the Russell are going in opposite directions, likely that will produce chop in the ES. This is not always true, though. The ES can act on its own. To remember, we are trading the ES and NOT the NQ/Russel.

##### Order-flow and delta

For the ES you want to be able to refine your entry as much as possible to reduce the possibility of having normal market volatility stop you out. Reading order-flow enables you to do that. In addition, reading order-flow throughout the day is a great way to gauge the dominant side and how aggressive they are. Bar charts do not show you enough information to be able to get an accurate read on the market. Order-flow enables you to MORE accurately determine which scenario is in play. Order-flow is the most important of all the tools outlined here as it is what is happening in the ES vs what is in the broad market.

#### Execution

Define the area where the trade idea is wrong and execute as close to that area as possible and within your risk parameters. Refined entries are required for the majority of trades in the ES. I have found that using order-flow is the best way to refine your entries. The reason for this is that ES tends to thrash around at key areas due to the supply and demand imbalances that these areas produce and also because of the games institutions may be playing with retail traders at these areas. Order-flow reveals this action and you can adjust accordingly. There is a reason the ES often reaches just beyond support and resistance zones, seemingly invalidating these areas and then reversing. Resting orders and bar charts put you at a disadvantage in the ES. 

Another thing to keep in mind is the overall condition of the market. Is the market volatile? If so, that's more likely to produce a choppy test of support and resistance. Is the movement to support and resistance strong? Then that is likely to produce a choppier test. Is the market balancing ahead of support and resistance? Then all the traders who entered positions in that short-term balance area will be forced to exit their positions as price pushes into support and resistance and that will likely produce a choppier test.

#### Trade management

Scaling should only be done when you are forced to due to market conditions reducing the potential of the trade idea. Otherwise, use an all-in, all-out approach. Scaling forces you to have a higher win rate. All-in, all-out gives you a margin for error and forces you to focus on trades with more potential. All-in, all-out is also a lot easier from a risk management standpoint. 

Scaling should never be an emotional response. Follow the scenarios.

#### Risk management

Risk 1R per trade, whatever that is according to your risk tolerance. Target 2R+ per trade and never take trades with less potential than that. Scenarios dictate the potential of trade ideas.

#### FOMO and Psychology

Not every swing in the ES is tradeable. If you did not plan for the trade in a scenario, then you did not miss out on anything. I am a risk manager first and foremost. The market has to work to present me with an opportunity that I can afford, can understand, and have planned for in my scenarios for the day. The market does not present me with surprise trades.
