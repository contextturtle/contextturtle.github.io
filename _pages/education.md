### Learn how to find key support and resistance zones, determine scenarios, and read the market

Through Patreon I offer a paid service for $25/month in which I daily detail how I came up with the zones and scenarios for that given day. The $25/month is to compensate me for the time it takes to produce this extra content. I use Patreon as it is a secure and trusted membership platform that handles all the logisitcs for me. $25/month is half a single ES point or 5 MES points for a single contract, which I think is completely reasonable. From this service I guarantee you will learn how to read the market and create your own zones and scenarios, which will be applicable to all financial markets and not just the S&P500.

### Learn how to trade the zones and scenarios

Everything is traded in context of the scenarios laid out in the pre-market analysis. I firmly believe profitable trading is rooted in planned trades that eliminate the need to do much thinking during the day. 95% of trades I take are in the zones. The trades that I somehow find throughout the day are typically my losing trades.

#### There are primarily four types of trades I take
* Zone fade reversal (position based)
* Zone fade bounce (position based)
* Breakout / breakdown (momentum based)
* Zone flip / pull-back (momentum based)

#### Tools used for analysis:
* NYSE and S&P500 advance-decline 
* NYSE TICK 
* Inter-market analysis including NQ and the Russel 
* Order-flow

### NYSE and S&P500 advance-decline 

Unless there is some very, very obvious divergence across both the NYSE and S&P500 ADs, then the AD is useless. If at the open, the ADs are very strong and showing very high values and the ES is below the prior day's cash close, then that has the potential to eventually be priced into the ES and cause a movement up. In addition, if at a key support zone and the ADs are both clearly holding up for the day, then that is a divergence and a has the potential to eventually be priced into the ES and cause a movement up. 

### NYSE TICK

The NYSE TICK is a great short-term momentum gauge, indicating how aggressive buyers and sellers in the broad market are being. When the TICK is swinging from +600s to -600s, the market is primarily balanced. When the TICK is primarily sustained above 0 and testing the +600s area or sustained below 0 and testing the -600s area, then the market is typically directional. NYSE TICK divergences have proven to be meaningless.

### Inter-market analysis including NQ and the Russel 

Simply, for sustained moves, the three indexes should be in alignment. If the ES is breaking out or breaking down and the move is to be sustained in the short-term, all three indices should be doing the same.

### Order-flow

For the ES you want to be able to refine your entry as much as possible to reduce the possibility of having normal market volatility stop you out. Reading order-flow enables you to do that. In addition, reading order-flow throughout the day is a great way to gauge the dominant side and how aggressive they are. Bar charts do not show you enough information to be able to get an accurate read on the market.

#### Trade management

Scaling should only be done when forced to. Otherwise, us al all-in, all-out approach. Scaling forces you to have a higher win rate. All-in, all-out gives you a margin for error.

#### Risk management

Risk 1R per trade. Target 2R+ per trade and never take trades with less potenial than that. Scenarios dictate the potential of trade ideas.
