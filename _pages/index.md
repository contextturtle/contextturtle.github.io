## What is Context Turtle?

{% include components/intro.md %}


## How is the Daily Context Report different?

There are a lot of services out there that provide support and resistance levels. These services would have you fade every level. Trust me, that is a losing strategy. What these other services lack is context. The Context Report provides that missing element. Instead of fading every move at every support and resistance level, you will be best aligned with the context to trade with the market rather than against it.


## How to use the Daily Context Report?

Use the report to get a better understanding of what the current day's context is within the E-Mini S&P 500 Futures market. This context adds to your edge, enabling you to more accurately judge what the probabilities favor and what the risk:reward ratio is. 

Using your existing suite of indicators/internals/tools, etc., trade within context and your edge will be sharpened.
