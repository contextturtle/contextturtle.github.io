title: E-Mini S&P 500 Futures Daily Context, Trade Plan, and Key Support/Resistance Zones for Day Traders
---

## What is this site?

Context Turtle is a free service providing the daily Context Report for the E-Mini S&P 500 Futures (ES and MES). In this daily report is included key support and resistance zones, the current contextual and structural layout, scenarios to be aware of, as well as volatility analysis, prior day key levels, and key economic events for the day. The Context Report is posted each morning around 9:00 am ET (Eastern Time). Review is also posted daily after the market closes before 9:00 pm ET.

## How is the Daily Context Report different?

There are a lot of services out there that provide support and resistance levels. These services would have you fade every level. Trust me, that is a losing strategy. What these other services lack is context. The Context Report provides that missing element. Instead of fading every move at every support and resistance level, you will be best aligned with the context to trade with the market rather than always against it.


## How to use the Daily Context Report?

Use the report to get a better understanding of what the current day's context is within the E-Mini S&P 500 Futures market. This context adds to your edge, enabling you to more accurately judge what the probabilities favor and what the risk:reward ratio is. 

Trade within the context laid out using your existing tools (indictors, internals, intermarket analysis, etc.) to improve your edge and put probability in your favor.
