#### How should I use the Context Report to improve my trading?
  * You can incorporate the Context Report into your current trading by filtering in/out signals that your current method prodcues within the context and scenarios outlined.
  * You can use the report as an educational reference to learn how to read the context of the ES. I encourage you to prepare your own contextual analysis and refer to mine as another pair of eyes.
  * You can simply just use the zones or volatility analysis and forget about the rest of the report if you prefer.

#### What is the "Bias / Directional Inclination / Control" section?
  * The bias is not predictive, but a read on the current directional inclination of each timeframe that is most relevant at the time for day trading.

#### What are the scenarios in the Context Report?
  * The scenarios are what I expect to happen if certain conditions are met. Upside and downside scenarios are accounted for in the report.

#### What is initial support and initial resistance?
  * The most immediate KEY support/resistance to keep an eye on in the context/scenarios outlined.

#### What kind of trades do you take daily?
  * My intraday trades tend to fall in one of these classifications:
    * Fade for bounce (FFB). Against larger timeframe, typically, but the r:r for the bounce is appealing. (location based)
    * Fade for reversal (FFR). Larger timeframe continuation. (location based)
    * Continuation (C) (momentum based)
    * Breakout (BO) / breakdown (BD) (location based)
    * Failed breakout (FBO) / breakdown (FBD) (location based)

#### What days will the report not be generated?
  * Market holidays. See: https://www.nyse.com/markets/hours-calendars

#### What time zone is used throughout this site?
  * Eastern Time (ET).

#### Why is the ContextTurtle site in "BETA"?
  * At some point there will be a fee to receive the morning report at 9:00 am ET. 

#### What will change after the BETA period ends?
  * The report will be disseminated as a newsletter via e-mail at around 9:00 am ET for a fee (around $20 USD/month). The report and review will be freely available after the market closes on this site for those who do not need to receive the report before the market opens.

#### What is the meaning of the name "Context Turtle"?
  * "Context" is of course due to the context focus of the Context Report.
  * "Turtle" is from the first book I ever read on trading: Way of the Turtle by Curtis Faith.
