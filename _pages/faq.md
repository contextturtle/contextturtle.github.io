#### How should I use the Context Report to improve my trading?
  * You can incorporate the Context Report into your current trading by filtering in/out signals that your current method prodcues within the context and scenarios outlined.
  * You can use the report as an educational reference to learn how to read the context of the ES. I encourage you to prepare your own contextual analysis and refer to mine as another pair of eyes.
  * You can simply just use the zones or volatility analysis and forget about the rest of the report if you prefer.

#### What kind of trades do you take daily?
  * My intraday trades tend to fall in one of these classifications:
    * Fade for small bounce (FFB). Against larger timeframe, typically, but the r:r for the bounce is appealing. (location based)
    * Fade for reversal (FFR). Larger timeframe continuation. (location based)
    * Continuation (C) (momentum based)
    * Breakout (BO) / breakdown (BD) (location based)
    * Failed breakout (FBO) / breakdown (FBD) (location based)
